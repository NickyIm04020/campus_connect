# 🎓 Campus Connect

> A unified digital platform to enhance student engagement, streamline communication, and simplify campus life.

## 🚀 About the Project

**Campus Connect** is a modern, student-centric platform built to centralize campus events, club activities, academic announcements, and shared resources into one responsive web application.

This project is part of my transition into **Product Management**, where I demonstrate not just technical awareness but also end-to-end product thinking—from identifying user problems to delivering value via a working MVP.

To accelerate the development process and improve efficiency, I utilized **AI tools like ChatGPT** for brainstorming, architectural guidance, and documentation assistance—just like modern PMs in agile teams do.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Campus communication today is fragmented—events are missed, club activities are poorly coordinated, and students struggle to find reliable updates or academic content. WhatsApp groups and noticeboards dominate, creating noise instead of clarity.

**Campus Connect** solves this by offering a single, intuitive, and role-based platform to bring structure and connectivity to college life.

## 👥 Target Audience

- 🎓 Students (UG & PG)
- 🏛️ Club Organizers & Core Members
- 👨‍💼 Campus Administrators

Each group gets tailored visibility and access depending on their role and responsibilities.
